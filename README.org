* What is MobileOrg?
  MobileOrg is a FREE (open-source) iPhone and iPod Touch application
  for storing, searching, viewing and editing your Org-mode files.

  MobileOrg works offline. Although you may not always be online, you
  can always access your data. You can even capture notes while offline
  and sync the next time you have connectivity.

* MobileOrg feature overview
 - Support for Dropbox or WebDAV as a transfer mechanism
 - Org files are stored offline and available anywhere
 - Complete editing support, including editable headings, body text, todo
   state, tags and priority.
 - Note-taking facility built in, including offline support
 - Full-text search, or search by keyword (TODO, DONE, WAITING) or by tag
   (errand, office)
 - Mark nodes as done, or flag them with an optional note for reference
   later
 - Document view of your outlines, for reading document-style Org files
   with long body text
 - Powerful support for linking between Org files

* Org-mode integration
  Org-mode has built-in support for MobileOrg (or any other mobile
  client that may come along in the future and use the same asymmetric
  synchronization approach).

  - A simple org-mobile-push will stage your complete set of Org-files for
    MobileOrg to pick them up. The result includes:
    + An Org file representing all of your custom agenda views
    + Automatic checksum file construction to speed up sync
    + Automatic index.org file generation with links to all of your Org files
  - A powerful org-mobile-pull command, which will integrate changes
    youâ€™ve made on the go into a local Org file
